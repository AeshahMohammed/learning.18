The Learning Journey app

It Tracks your goals, One day at a time

it is a SwiftUI-based app that helps users stay consistent with their learning goals.
You can set what you want to learn, choose how long you want to commit for (a week, a month, or even a year) and track your daily progress, one day at a time.

The app motivates users to keep learning, allows a limited number of “freeze” days for rest, and celebrates their achievements once they complete their chosen learning goal.
